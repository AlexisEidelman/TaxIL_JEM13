First thank you for coming so numerous. I's an important milestone for me and my model to be criticised by experimented people in so many fields and of course in microsimulation. 
As the project is very young don't hesitate to challenge it, what you can tell me today can really impact and improve it.

Reforms can be reform in the tax and benefit system, but as the ageing is done by the model you can also evaluate socio-demographic change. Increase in marriage or for example in house pricing.

I can't say enoutgh how a work in progress it is. In particular it's a bit frustrating for you as for me not to have first results to show you.
