First thank you for coming so numerous. I's an important milestone for me and my model to be criticised by experimented people in so many fields and of course in microsimulation. 
As the project is very young don't hesitate to challenge it, what you can tell me today can really impact and improve it.

Reforms can be reform in the tax and benefit system, but as the ageing is done by the model you can also evaluate socio-demographic change. Increase in marriage or for example in house pricing.

I can't say enoutgh how a work in progress it is. In particular it's a bit frustrating for you as for me not to have first results to show you.  

Frame 1 : Ineualities
There is different good reaon we want to have a lifetime income more than a annual one even just to look at inequlities. 
We must remember that what is interesting in inequalities is not income but utility or living standard. The income is usualy considered as the best proxy we have (and also one that can be affected by public policies) but in that sense, in my view it's not enought). 
* First an annual income may differ from the previous or the next year. You can encounter unemployment, bas harvest, bonus, a capital gain and so long. 
* Then, your income is a very bad prox when you are not in your production time. When you're a student and with no income you're supposed to accumulate human capital and when you're retired and you're suppose to consume your savings. Note that if a student is supported by her or his parents, that student is considered as poorer than a student working part-time because she or he doesn't recieve any parental assistance.
Usualy, student are removed from inequalities survey. It's a good way not qnswering the issue of student income. 
Pensioner remains even if there is some reason we can find in justice theory to remove them. 
* And, an other very instersting point in using the whole life cycle, is that wealth and inheritance can be considered as income at a given time. That way we solve the issue of the poor wealthy people, I mean people with big savings but low income.
