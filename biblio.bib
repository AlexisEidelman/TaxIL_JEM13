  abstract = {Equality of opportunity is an ethical goal with almost universal appeal.
	The interpretation taken here is that a society has achieved equality
	of opportunity if it is the case that what individuals accomplish,
	with respect to some desirable objective, is determined wholly by
	their choices and personal effort, rather than by circumstances beyond
	their control. We use data for Swedish men born between 1955 and
	1967 for whom we measure the distribution of long-run income, as
	well as several important background circumstances, such as parental
	education and income, family structure and own IQ before adulthood.
	We address the question: in Sweden, given its present constellation
	of social policies and institutions, to what extent is existing income
	inequality due to circumstances, as opposed to 'effort'? Our results
	suggest that several circumstances, importantly both parental income
	and own IQ, are important for long-run income inequality, but that
	variations in individual effort account for the most part of that
	inequality.},
