  abstract = {This paper analyzes the evolution of tax progressivity in Sweden from
	both annual and lifetime perspectives.Using a rich micro panel with
	administrative records of incomes, taxes and benefits over the period
	1968–2009, we calculate tax rates across the income distribution
	accounting for different tax bases as well as the role of transfers.
	The uniquely long time span also allows us to compute tax progressivity
	as realized over a cohort’s entire life cycle. Our main finding is
	that taxes are considerably less progressive over the lifetime than
	in any single year. In fact, life cycle taxes are close to proportional,
	bearing a redistributive effect of only a few percent. Intragenerational
	income mobility seems to be driving this result, although the Swedish
	economic crisis of the 1990s and the tax reforms of 1971 and 1991
	are also important. Labor income taxes contribute less to progressivity
	in recent years,whereas transfers to unemployed and old-age pensioners
	have become increasingly important. These findings are robust to
	the use of different tax rates, tax bases, sample populations, rates
	of discounting and controls for reranking.},

	income in Germany, 8.5 percent in the U.S. Redistribution has reduced
	these risks from their pre-tax, pre-transfer levels by 43 percent
	in Germany, 21 percent in the U.S. The political importance of income
	security is evident in both countries, as risk relief often eliminates
	the net burden of redistributive taxes among middle-class households.
	The conclusions are robust across several models of income expectations.

	the distributions of annual income and 'lifetime' income. It is found
	that the dispersion of lifetime income is around 35 to 40 percent
	lower than typical cross-sections of annual income. It is income
	up to around 30 years of age that mainly explains this discrepancy
	in the magnitude of dispersions. From the age of 30 until 65 years
	the correlations between annual and lifetime income are quite high
	and the dispersion of annual income is not very much higher than
	the dispersion of lifetime income. An analysis of the evolution of
	income mobility shows that there is a slight tendency to rising mobility

	We address the question: in Sweden, given its present constellation
	of social policies and institutions, to what extent is existing income
	inequality due to circumstances, as opposed to 'effort'? Our results
	suggest that several circumstances, importantly both parental income
	and own IQ, are important for long-run income inequality, but that
	variations in individual effort account for the most part of that

	the distribution of lifetime incomes, the public budget, and economic
	efficiency. Our analysis suggests that, even with conservative assumptions
